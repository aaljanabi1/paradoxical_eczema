**Paradoxical eczema single cell code**

This repository includes code (bash and R) used for primary analyses of the single cell transcriptome and CyTOF data from patients with paradoxical eczema (cases), psoriasis (controls) and healthy volunteers. Individual-level single cell RNA-Seq and genotype data for the paradoxical eczema cases and psoriasis controls can be found under BioProject accession code PRJNA1032546. Individual-level CyTOF data for paradoxical eczema cases, psoriasis controls and healthy volunteers can be found at FlowRepository under Repository ID FR-FCM-Z7ZS.
